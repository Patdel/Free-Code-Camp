These are my answers to the code challenges for the Bonfire Algorithms section ot the Free Code Camp course. The solutions are mostly based on the methods taught in the Basic JavaScript section of the course. As is also expected for these challenges, I searched online for bits of code that could help me solve a couple of these. The most relevant I found was the one for the "Bonfire Title Case a Sentence" challenge. The information I found online helped me come up with this bit of code:
  
  inArray[i].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + inArray[i].slice(1);
  
I really tried to come up with this answer on my own, but I realized that sometimes it is best to ask for help.
  
I also used as a reference the book "A Smarter Way To Learn JavaScript" by Mark Myers that has a complete website with exercises to go along with it. I completed this entire book, along with the online exercises, during th summer of 2015 and this gave me the confidence necessary to start creating my algorithms for these challenges with almost no help.
